Created three cloud based folders, one for text files, one for pictures larger than 200 KB, and one for smaller pictures.
    - allows a user to list the contents of any of the three remote folders 
    - allows a user to select which folder an upload will go to (or your program may determine this
      based on the local file type, this is your choice.)
    - do not allow the total size of the contents of any folder to exceed a user specified size
      (for example the size of all files in a folder must be smaller than 500 KB).
